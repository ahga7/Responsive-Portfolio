				<h1>About Ahmed</h1>
				
				<p><img id="img" src="assets/images/profile.jpg"> Hello, my name is Ahmed. I'm 24 years old, and this is my first "original" website.
				I'm a DIY enthusiast and enjoy restoring old VW's when I'm not learning web development. I taught my self french when I was younger, and also introduced myself to html and css. I find learning languages quite "easy" if I learn the grammar first or in this case the language "rules".</p>

				<br>

				<p>I'm currently working in HVAC maintenance, but I'm looking forward to using the skills I'm learning. After completing this coding bootcamp I would like to gain my first clients by developing and launching websites for friends of mine that own their own buisnesses, and also maybe develope stock trading related software since I also <em>play</em> the market every now and then.</p>
